**How it Started**

During my first few months working in hotel food service, I consistently observed significant amounts of food being discarded daily after breakfast service. As someone who values sustainability and efficient resource management, this waste troubled me both personally and professionally. Rather than accepting it as "just how things work in this industry," I wanted to understand the root cause and find a practical solution.

**Collaborative Initiative**

After identifying the food waste issue, I brought this concern to management while approached my colleagues to discuss why this issue needed immediate attention and how we could collaboratively address it. The initial suggestion was to use a daily memo where breakfast staff would leave expected guest numbers and amount of food that they need to prepared. Using existing systems sounds good enough. However, I saw this as problematic for three reasons: 

1. It would cause redundant work since night staff already had access to guest reservation information. 
2. Even if breakfast staff left notes, we ourselves had no standardized guidelines to determine appropriate preparation quantities. So what numbers would we actually provide?
3. I was concerned that forgetting to leave these memos could create a blame culture between shifts, potentially damaging our collaborative working relationship.

**Problem Analysis**

- Conducted interviews with colleagues to understand current workflow processes and identify operational inefficiencies
- Diagnosed lack of standardized preparation guidelines resulting in food quantities determined based on personal judgment
- Reliance on personal judgement rather than standardized protocols was directly causing not only over-preparation and subsequent food waste but also inconsistent feedback leaving staff confused

**Data-Driven Solution Design**

- Executed one week observational study to establish baseline metrics for daily guest volume vs. food preparation quantities
- Calculated statistical averages and identified patterns in consumption data to develop evidence-based preparation standards
- Designed and implemented standardized preparation guidelines based on quantitative analysis

**Implementation & Improvement** 

- Conducted 1 month pilot testing program to validate effectiveness of new protocols
- Facilitated team meetings to gather feedback and optimize guidelines
- Refined preparation quantities based on real-world results

**Impact & Results**

- Achieved measurable reduction in daily food waste through data-driven guideline implementation across multi-shift operations
- Improved team communication by eliminating inconsistent feedback and blame-shifting between shifts by establishing clear, objective preparation standards

**Personal Reflection**

This project was particularly meaningful as it was my first exposure to a shift-based work environment. Navigating communication across different shifts presented unique challenges that required me to think creatively about how to establish clear, efficient, and practical communication channels. The experience taught me valuable lessons about cross-functional collaboration in complex operational settings.
